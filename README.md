# World_Weather_Analysis
using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas library, CitiPy, Python Requests, API's, and JSON Traversals to collect, analyze, and display weather data and plan vacations

Retrieved weather data and added a brief description. Added a feature for beta testers to input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Used the Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
